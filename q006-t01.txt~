- Herman Bavinck

The laws of thought are the same for all; the theory of numbers is everywhere the same; the difference between good and evil is known by all.
- Herman Bavinck

Just as people, upon opening their eyes, automatically see the sun and by its light discern objects, so by their very nature—the moment they hear that there is a God and a difference between good and evil—they must assent to these statements.
- Herman Bavinck

From the general ideas and norms present in the human mind, that is, from that reason which transcends our individual reason and that of the entire world, it deduces the existence of absolute Reason, the sum total of all those ideas and norms, absolute truth, goodness, and beauty, that is, God (Plato, Augustine, Boethius, Anselm in his Monologium)
- Herman Bavinck

The theory of evolution has until now proved unable to explain the origin and essence of the human moral consciousness and in attempting to do so always confuses the good with the pleasant and the useful.

In Scripture, accordingly, he is called El, the strong One; El Shaddai, the mighty One; YHWH, the One who is there; he is called Father, Son, Spirit, good, merciful, gracious, just, holy (etc.); all of them are expressions that first of all apply to creatures and are then transferred to God by way of eminence. 
- Herman Bavinck

But Thomas, rejecting this view, already correctly countered that in that case God could equally well be called “gold,” “silver,” “sun,” “moon,” “body,” and so on, since he is certainly the cause of these creations; furthermore, [he argued] that all of us mean something different and more when we say “God is good” than when we say “God is the cause of goodness.” 
- Herman Bavinck

Augustine variously describes God as “supreme being,” “the supreme good, truth, beauty,” and so forth.

God is alternately described as “that which has being,” “absolute being,” “absolute substance”; or as “Sovereign,” “the Lord,” “the Supreme Being”; or as “infinite Spirit,” “absolute causality,” “absolute personality”; or as the “Father,” “love,” “the personal almighty will of love,” “goodness,” and so forth. 
- Herman Bavinck

Also Philo, reflecting Plato’s influence, often represented the divine energies—especially his goodness, power, and rationality (logos)—as hypostases (substances)

- Herman Bavinck

God’s goodness is much more glorious when it is shown to those who only deserve evil. … In addition, the goodness of God appears as love when it not only conveys certain benefits but God himself.
- Herman Bavinck

Pseudo-Dionysius, accordingly, spoke of God’s love as “an endless circle [traveling] through the Good, from the Good, in the Good, and to the Good, unerringly turning, ever on the same center, ever in the same direction, always proceeding, always remaining, always being restored to itself.”

Augustine points out that God often fulfills his good will through the malicious will of humans.
- Herman Bavinck

In fact, Augustine’s position does more justice to God’s holiness, for it is more in accordance with Scripture and Christian faith as a whole to believe that for good and wise reasons, though these reasons are unknown to us, God has in a certain sense willed sin than to believe that, not willing it in any sense, he tolerates and permits it.
