- Herman Bavinck

The laws of thought are the same for all; the theory of numbers is everywhere the same; the difference between good and evil is known by all.
- Herman Bavinck

Just as people, upon opening their eyes, automatically see the sun and by its light discern objects, so by their very nature—the moment they hear that there is a God and a difference between good and evil—they must assent to these statements.
- Herman Bavinck

From the general ideas and norms present in the human mind, that is, from that reason which transcends our individual reason and that of the entire world, it deduces the existence of absolute Reason, the sum total of all those ideas and norms, absolute truth, goodness, and beauty, that is, God (Plato, Augustine, Boethius, Anselm in his Monologium)
- Herman Bavinck

The theory of evolution has until now proved unable to explain the origin and essence of the human moral consciousness and in attempting to do so always confuses the good with the pleasant and the useful.

The idea of a moral world order apart from a personal, righteous, and holy God cannot be clearly conceived and ends with the apotheosis of the abstract power of goodness. 
- Herman Bavinck

In Scripture, accordingly, he is called El, the strong One; El Shaddai, the mighty One; YHWH, the One who is there; he is called Father, Son, Spirit, good, merciful, gracious, just, holy (etc.); all of them are expressions that first of all apply to creatures and are then transferred to God by way of eminence. 
- Herman Bavinck

But Thomas, rejecting this view, already correctly countered that in that case God could equally well be called “gold,” “silver,” “sun,” “moon,” “body,” and so on, since he is certainly the cause of these creations; furthermore, [he argued] that all of us mean something different and more when we say “God is good” than when we say “God is the cause of goodness.” 
- Herman Bavinck

Augustine variously describes God as “supreme being,” “the supreme good, truth, beauty,” and so forth.
- Herman Bavinck

For the doctrine of God this meant that the essence of God was exclusively identified with ethical goodness.

God is alternately described as “that which has being,” “absolute being,” “absolute substance”; or as “Sovereign,” “the Lord,” “the Supreme Being”; or as “infinite Spirit,” “absolute causality,” “absolute personality”; or as the “Father,” “love,” “the personal almighty will of love,” “goodness,” and so forth. 
- Herman Bavinck

Also Philo, reflecting Plato’s influence, often represented the divine energies—especially his goodness, power, and rationality (logos)—as hypostases (substances)

- Herman Bavinck

It has been linked to the word good, to the Avestan khoda (self-existent), to the Sanskrit gudha, or gutha, which is said to refer to God as “the hidden One.” Other possibilities are the Indo-Germanic root ghu (Sanskrit hû), which means “to call upon” and is therefore said to refer to God as “the One called upon,” or to a stem κοδω (κοσμος), which is said to mean “to order, to arrange,” or to the Aryan cuddhas (pure, good).

Indeed, the word “good” often has this meaning, as when we speak of a “good” house, a “good” friend, and so forth, and mean by it that a person or thing has certain good qualities and is useful for some purpose.
- Herman Bavinck

Used in that sense, the word “good” has no independent concrete meaning of its own but depends for its meaning on the purpose that the person or thing must serve and hence varies in meaning with different peoples. 
- Herman Bavinck

The category of the good in general includes goods that are useful, delightful, aesthetic, and ethically sound.

And God, as the perfect and blessed One, is the supreme good for his creatures, “the supreme good all things strive for, the fount of all good things, the good of every good, the one necessary and all-sufficient good, the end of all goods” (Ps. 4:6–7; 73:25–26).
- Herman Bavinck

Especially Augustine frequently described God as “the supreme good.”

- Herman Bavinck

God’s goodness is much more glorious when it is shown to those who only deserve evil. … In addition, the goodness of God appears as love when it not only conveys certain benefits but God himself.
- Herman Bavinck

Pseudo-Dionysius, accordingly, spoke of God’s love as “an endless circle [traveling] through the Good, from the Good, in the Good, and to the Good, unerringly turning, ever on the same center, ever in the same direction, always proceeding, always remaining, always being restored to itself.”
- Herman Bavinck

Augustine points out that God often fulfills his good will through the malicious will of humans.
- Herman Bavinck

In fact, Augustine’s position does more justice to God’s holiness, for it is more in accordance with Scripture and Christian faith as a whole to believe that for good and wise reasons, though these reasons are unknown to us, God has in a certain sense willed sin than to believe that, not willing it in any sense, he tolerates and permits it. 
- Herman Bavinck

His [God the Father’s] is the purpose (Acts 4:28; Eph. 1:11), the good pleasure (Matt. 11:26; Eph. 1:9), the initiative in creation and re-creation (Ps. 33:6; John 3:16), the kingdom and the power (ἐξουσια, δυναμις, Matt. 6:13 KJV; Rom. 1:20; Eph. 1:19), the righteousness (Gen. 18:25; Deut. 32:4; John 17:25; Rom. 3:26; 2 Tim. 4:8), the goodness, wisdom, immortality, unapproachable light (Matt. 19:17; Rom. 16:27; 1 Tim. 6:16).

The most essential content of natural religion is given by RIISSEN thus (I, 7): “(1) that God is, (2) and that He must be worshipped, (3) that we must live good lives, (4) that the soul is immortal, (5) that a reward is due to virtue, punishment to wickedness”
- Heinrich Heppe, Reformed Dogmatics

Man the sinner retained reason, to which nature and an ingrained idea and notion of Deity suggested that which was known of God (Rom. 1:19): God making the revelation through nature; and (ii) God’s ποιήματα brought to their notice and view the invisible things of Him from the creation, namely His everlasting divinity and power; and (iii) conscience, which, bearing in its bosom the work of the law written in man’s heart and so the good and bad taught by that law, as it were powerfully defends man in things rightly done before God the Judge, accusing him in those badly done (Rom. 2:15.). 
- Heinrich Heppe, Reformed Dogmatics

God’s will is that attribute of God (POLAN II, 19) “by which He wills good as an end and everything for good, from all eternity, of His own self and independently and by one constant act”, or (MASTRICHT, II, xv, 8): “God’s will is His most wise propension towards Himself as the supreme end and towards the creatures as means for His own sake
- Heinrich Heppe, Reformed Dogmatics

Reformed dogmaticians as a whole are occupied with the question, whether goodness is good because God wills it, or whether God wills the good because it is good. 
- Heinrich Heppe, Reformed Dogmatics

In reply to the objection that, if there is something good and right antecedently to God’s will, then God must dutifully will and do it, which contradicts the absolute nature of God, VOETIUS rightly (!) insists (373) that “God is under no moral duty ab extra; He is due no one and there is no cause outside God which could bind or determine Him.
- Heinrich Heppe, Reformed Dogmatics

But with respect to God, although in those things which have free and positive goodness, as in ceremonies so instituted as also to admit of abolition, God’s will is the first rule of righteousness; in those, however, which have innate goodness, the actual will of God derives a rule from no other source than from His essential holiness, righteousness and goodness or from His most Holy nature.

Each of us must, then, be so stung by the consciousness of his own unhappiness as to attain at least some knowledge of God. bThus, from the feeling of our own ignorance, vanity, poverty, infirmity, and—what is more—depravity and corruption, we recognize that the true light of wisdom, sound virtue, full abundance of every good, and purity of righteousness rest in the Lord alone.
- John Calvin

To this extent we are prompted by our own ills to contemplate the good things of God; and we cannot seriously aspire to him before we begin to become displeased with ourselves.
- John Calvin

Moreover, although our mind cannot apprehend God without rendering some honor to him, it will not suffice simply to hold e(b/a)that there is One whom all ought to honor and adore, unless we are also persuaded that he is the fountain of every good, and that we must seek nothing elsewhere than in him.
- John Calvin

This I take to mean that not only does he sustain this universe (as he once founded it) by his boundless might, regulate it by his wisdom, preserve it by his goodness, and especially rule mankind by his righteousness and judgment, bear with it in his mercy, watch over it by his protection; but also that no drop will be found either of wisdom and light, or of righteousness or power or rectitude, or of genuine truth, which does not flow from him, and of which he is not the cause.
- John Calvin

For until men recognize that they owe everything to God, that they are nourished by his fatherly care, that he is the Author of their every good, that they should seek nothing beyond him—they will never yield him willing service.
